# Memory Game with LCD Display
This Arduino project is designed using an Arduino Nano. To enhance the user experience, I have integrated an I2C LCD display (16 x 2). The display shows the highest score and the current score during the game.

Furthermore, I have included a loading screen to make the experience more enjoyable. The best part is that I utilized the EEPROM to achieve this. For more details on using EEPROM, you can refer to this link: https://maker.pro/arduino/tutorial/how-to-permanently-store-data-on-your-arduino.

With the EEPROM, the high score is stored on the chip permanently, even when it is not connected to a PC.

# Enjoy the game!
